#Why Have I this Repostiory

I have had a difficulty learning JavaScript the normal way I kept giving up on it. I then discovered a lesson on how to understand 
Javascript on a visual level making easy for me to possibly and finally get a grasp on the langauge.

Using p5.js I will try for myself as a goal to atleast upload one or two small tasks or projects to complete.
